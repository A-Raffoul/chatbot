The provided table presents survey results regarding the perceptions of General Practitioners and laypersons on various statements about antipsychotic drug treatment. The columns compare the responses of two groups concerning their level of agreement or disagreement with specific statements, each quantified by percentages. Additionally, the last column appears to provide statistical significance (p-values) for the comparisons between the two groups. The statements address the effectiveness, risks, and implications of antipsychotic drug treatment, along with its impact on hospital stays.
